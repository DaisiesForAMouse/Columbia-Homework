At 10 credits, the student has an opportunity cost of $\$250$ that could be spent on other goods for taking an extra credit.

However, at 13 credits, the student would just be paying the bulk payment of $\$3000$ for the semester, so there is no opportunity cost for another credit other than the time that she must invest into the credit.

        \draw[dashed] (6,0) -- (10,4);  
		\end{tikzpicture}

\subsubsection*{a.2}
An example utility function for Alan can be the Cobbs-Douglas utility function, $U(q_c, q_m) = q_c^{0.5}q_m^{0.5}$.

An example utility function for Bob can be $U(q_c,q_m) = \min(q_c,q_m)$. The dashed line marks the kinks of the contours of the utility function.

\subsection*{b)}
\subsubsection*{b.1}

We have that $MRS_{Y,X} = -\frac{MU_X}{MU_Y}$.

\begin{align*}
		MU_X &= \frac{\delta U}{\delta x} = (y + z) \\
		MU_Y &= \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} = x \\
		\implies MRS_{Y,X} &= -\frac{y+z}{x}
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{b.2}

$|MRS_{Y,X}|$ would fall from $\frac{y+100}{x}$ to $\frac{y+80}{x}$, a fall in magnitude of $\frac{20}{x}$.
This means that consumers would be less willing to substitute air travel for other goods (specifically they would be willing to give up $\frac{20}{x}$ less for an extra mile traveled by air).

\subsubsection*{b.3}

This makes sense, because after 9/11 airline safety would go down, so that consumers are less willing to sacrifice other spending for air travel, decreasing the amount of people traveling by air.
In the context of 9/11, this would suggest not particularly that people's tastes have changed, but their information has changed (9/11 makes consumers think that airline travel is unsafe), leading them to stay away from air travel.

\subsubsection*{b.4}

We now have that $MRS_{Y,X} = \frac{yz}{xz} = \frac{y}{x}$. This means that $MRS_{Y,Z}$ is independent of $Z$, which doesn't make that much sense, as you would expect a change in airline safety to either increase or decrease travel. 

In another sense this is strange also because $MU_Y = xz$. Why would the marginal utility of other spending depend specifically on the safety of air travel?

\section*{Problem 3}
\subsection*{a)}

Carla generally likes more even bundles (though skewed torwards clothes), as they appear to be imperfect substitutes to each other as shown by a Cobbs-Douglas utility function. However, since the exponent of clothing is higher in her utility function, we can conclude that she enjoys clothes more than food per each respective unit.

\subsection*{b)}

\begin{center}
		$MU_X = \frac{\delta U}{\delta x} = \frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3}y^{2/3} = \frac{1}{3}(\frac{y}{x})^{2/3}$.
\end{center}


This diminishes monotonically as $x$ increases, meaning that her marginal utility for food decreases as she consumes more food.

\subsection*{c)}

\begin{center}
		$5x + 25y = 900$ 
\end{center}

\subsection*{d)}

We can formally describe Carla's utility maximization problem as the following: find the maximum value of $U(x,y) = x^{1/3}y^{2/3}$ with $x,y \geq 0$ such that $5x + 25y = 900$.

\subsection*{e)}
\subsubsection*{e.1}
\begin{center}
		$\mathcal{L}(x,y,\lambda) = x^{1/3}y^{2/3} - \lambda(5x + 25y - 900)$
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{e.2}
\begin{align*}
		\frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta x} &= \frac{1}{3}(\frac{y}{x})^{2/3} - 5\lambda\\
		\frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta y} &= \frac{2}{3}(\frac{y}{x})^{-1/3} - 25\lambda\\
		\frac{\delta \mathcal{L}}{\delta \lambda} &= 5x + 25y - 900
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{e.3}
Setting them all equal to zero, we have the following:

\begin{alignat*}{2}
		&& \frac{1}{3}(\frac{y}{x})^{2/3} &= 5\lambda\\
		&& \frac{2}{3}(\frac{y}{x})^{-1/3} &= 25\lambda\\
		&\implies& \frac{1}{2}(\frac{y}{x}) &= \frac{1}{5}\\
		&\implies& y &= \frac{2}{5}x \\
		&\implies& 5x + 10x &= 900 \\
		&\implies& x &= 60 \\
		&\implies& y &= \frac{2}{5}(60) = 24 \\
		&\implies& \lambda &= \frac{1}{15}(\frac{24}{60})^{2/3} = 0.036
\end{alignat*}

 		\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The curve labeled IC is the indifference curve tangent to the budget constraint BC. They meet at the optimal bundle B$^*$, which contains 60 food and 24 clothes.

\subsection*{g)}

If she purchases her optimal bundle, then she spends $60(5) = 300$, or $1/3$ of her total budget on food. Similarly, she will spend $24(25) = 600$, or $2/3$ of her total budget on clothing.

\subsection*{h)} 

We notice quickly that the share of her budget spent on a good is exactly the exponent assigned to the good in the utility function.

\subsection*{i)}

Instead of $900$, we can solve the system for an arbitrary budget $M$. In that case, we arrive at $5x + 10x = M$ from part \textbf{e.3} instead of $5x + 10x = 900$ (as this is the first step where $M$ does not vanish in the manipulated equations after taking the partial derivative), meaning that $x = \frac{M}{15}$ and that $y = \frac{2M}{75}$ for the optimal bundle. This yields shares of $\frac{M}{15}(5) = \frac{1}{3}M$ spent on food and $\frac{2M}{75}(25) = \frac{2}{3}M$ spent on clothing. This implies that the shares spent on the goods are fixed independently of budget.

\subsection*{Problem 4}

\subsection*{a)}
She needs to complete exercise such that for every 10 minutes of running (or mile ran) she swims 2 minutes. This means that if $x$ represents the miles run, then $10x + 2x = 60$, so she ought to run 5 miles and 500m (50 minutes running, 10 minutes swimming).

As an aside, Vera is very very fit. That's a lot of cardio!

The line marked BC is the budget constraint. The indifference curve, labeled IC, is shaped as an L as the two are perfect compliments. The optimal bundle is marked B$^*$, at 5 miles ran, 500m swam. The slanted dotted line marks the ratio at which Vera wants to split running and swimming.
